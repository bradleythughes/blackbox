-- TODO for Blackbox - an X11 Window manager

netwm:
-----------------------------
* _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS requires that we move windows to the next
   workspace when the one they are on is closed.  However we currently
   iconify them instead

* _NET_WORKAREA is supposed to be an array of desktop geometries

warts:
-----------------------------
* vnc in full screen mode does not get focus

Stuff TODO or On The Way(tm):
-----------------------------
CHANGE: deiconify() is overloaded, we need a "place window on Workspace N" and
        "bring this window back from icon land"

CHANGE: as a corrolary to the above, BlackboxWindow::mapRequest should actually
        be called for map requests

CHECK: getBlackboxHints() and restoreAttributes() do a lot of the same work
       should look into whether it can be combined or not

CHANGE: sticky windows are not handled well

CHANGE: look into centering the window when maximizing and the window can not
        grow to fill the area

CHANGE: BlackboxWindow::deiconify needs a new name, also look into show()

ADD: add _BLACKBOX_STYLE and _BLACKBOX_MENU atoms so that bbtools, bbconf,
     etc. can get the current path to the style in use and menu.

ADD: subdirs in stylesmenu/dir will create a new submenu

ADD: UTF8 support

CHANGE: when workspace name is greater than the width of its text area the
	toolbar gets very ugly

CHANGE: rework the .blackboxrc resources so that they give a more
        uniform behavior across screens. (Still not sure how I want
	to do this, so it'll have to wait.)

ADD: get volunteers to translate blackbox into other languages

ADD: draw resize frames using the styles borderWidth... should be fairly
     simple to do...

ADD: always on top/bottom support

ADD: way to empty a menu with one method call something like menu.erase() or
     menu.removeAll()

ADD: way to have items in menu and store data other than their index number.
     The reason the Send To menu lists every workspace is because if it did
     not blackbox would have no way to know that the one labelled
     "Workspace 2" actually was workspace #2 and was referenced by
     workspace[1]. Something like menu.insert(item, data).

CHANGE: use a Workspace* instead of a number in BlackboxWindow

ADD: a regression test suite
     items to test:
       *) toggle decor works
       *) multihead

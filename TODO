-- TODO for Blackbox - an X11 Window manager

CVS Bugs:
-----------------------------
* sticky windows are not considered

* colour issue under Irix

* acroread transients

* xnc

* mozilla right click focus bug

* bbtools do not like to dock

CVS warts:
-----------------------------
* transient handling should be properly done for cases where a single toplevel
  has multiple transients... this includes transient stacking
  (partially finished)

* to accomplish the above, we NEED proper window group support... this includes
  supporting group leader, with multiple toplevels which can have multiple
  group transients... with group operations (iconify all, deiconify all,
  send all to workspace, etc.)

* the Xlib manual describes how the X server delivers focus events under
  all situations... generate a visual reference for all these circumstances.
  use this to solve all focusing issues.

* Send to menu should not list the current workspace
  idea: we could store the workspace number in the BasemenuItem

* strut does not handle hidden toolbar or slit properly, but how should it?

* look into centering the window when maximizing and the window can not grow
  to fill the area

* BlackboxWindow::deiconify needs a new name, also look into show()

Stuff TODO or On The Way(tm):
-----------------------------
ADD: add _BLACKBOX_STYLE and _BLACKBOX_MENU atoms so that bbtools, bbconf, etc.
     can get the current path to the style in use and menu.

ADD: subdirs in stylesmenu/dir will create a new submenu

ADD: UTF8 support

CHANGE: when workspace name is greater than the width of its text area the
	toolbar gets very ugly

CHANGE: rework the .blackboxrc resources so that they give a more
        uniform behavior across screens. (Still not sure how I want
	to do this, so it'll have to wait.)

ADD: support for KDE and GNOME via the new WM Spec at
     http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec/

ADD: get volunteers to translate blackbox into other languages

ADD: draw resize frames using the styles borderWidth... should be fairly
     simple to do...

ADD: always on top/bottom support

CHECK: look at why memory usage is up... RSS won't go < 1mb now
       i noticed a memory leak from improper handling of non-existant
       windows... this fixes this some... this will be on going

ADD: way to empty a menu with one method call something like menu.erase() or
     menu.removeAll()

ADD: way to have items in menu and store data other than their index number.
     The reason the Send To menu lists every workspace is because if it did
     not blackbox would have no way to know that the one labelled "Workspace 2"
     actually was workspace #2 and was referenced by workspace[1].
     something like menu.insert(item, data).

CHECK: why do we have workspace_number and attrib.workspace in BlackboWindow?

CHANGE: use a Workspace* instead of a number in BlackboxWindow

ADD: a regression test suite
     items to test:
       *) toggle decor works
       *) multihead

-- TODO for Blackbox - an X11 Window manager

* i18n/l10n (translations) support, need something else that can
  translate into either UTF-8 (needed for NETWM and Xft) or locale
  (for Xmb).

* make sure transients are correctly associated at startup. this is
  partially done by ensuring stacking order across restarts... we
  might be able to do more, but it's not urgent

* session support via the X session management protocol

* re-add support for tear-off menus to bt::Menu

* see about supporting specifications at www.freedesktop.org (for
  example, the basedirs-spec)... if the various bbtools also follow
  this spec (read: add something to libbt), then sharing data/config
  files is much easier

* the current style is stored only by name (not by path)... all styles
  have to placed in some directory ($XDG_DATA_DIRS/blackbox/styles,
  for example) in order for them to be found.  The menu could
  automatically search all $XDG_DATA_DIRS directories and build up the
  style menu, instead of the user having to edit his menu file to add
  new style directories... this also gives us the possibility of
  defining a style "package" format

* similarly, all config files (the rc, the menu file, a style
  "override" file) should be stored somewhere in $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS

* as mentioned above, allow the user to override anything in the
  style... either in the rc or in a separate "override" style

ADD: support user controlled window decoration

ADD: subdirs in stylesmenu/dir will create a new submenu

ADD: get volunteers to translate blackbox into other languages

ADD: a regression test suite
     items to test:
       *) toggle decor works
       *) multihead

CHANGE: look into centering the window when maximizing and the window can not
        grow to fill the area

CHANGE: move all of the fprintf() messages to a message function /
        class.  Something like message(WARN, "this is broken") and use
        sprintf() to allow for printf() style replacements.  This can
        be set to go to stderr, a log file, whatever.  It can also be
        disabled for final builds.

CHANGE: use less pointers and more references

-- TODO for Blackbox 0.60.x  - an X11 Window manager

Stuff TODO or On The Way(tm):
-----------------------------
FIX: focus handling needs revisiting for multiple screen displays... the
     method i have now seems to work fine for single screen...

DONE: get screen information from the XWindowAttributes.screen after calling
      XGetWindowAttributes... instead of looking XMapRequest.root and trying to
      search for a the BScreen*

DONE: when starting a resize... the vertical size will reduce slightly... fix it

ADD: draw resize frames using the styles borderWidth... should be fairly
     simple to do...

CHECK: look at why memory usage is up... RSS won't go < 1mb now
       i noticed a memory leak from improper handling of non-existant
       windows... this fixes this some... this will be on going

(still here) better support for window groups... i don't know when i'm going to
    ever get to this

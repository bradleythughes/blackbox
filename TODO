-- TODO for Blackbox 0.61.x  - an X11 Window manager

Stuff TODO or On The Way(tm):
-----------------------------
CHANGE: rework the .blackboxrc resources so that they give a more
        uniform behavior across screens. (Still not sure how I want
	to do this, so it'll have to wait.)

ADD: support for KDE2 via the new WM Spec at
     http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec/

ADD: get volunteers to translate blackbox into other languages

DONE: focus handling needs revisiting for multiple screen displays... the
      method i have now seems to work fine for single screen...

DONE: get screen information from the XWindowAttributes.screen after calling
      XGetWindowAttributes... instead of looking XMapRequest.root and trying to
      search for the BScreen*

DONE: when starting a resize... the vertical size will reduce slightly... fix it

ADD: draw resize frames using the styles borderWidth... should be fairly
     simple to do...

CHECK: look at why memory usage is up... RSS won't go < 1mb now
       i noticed a memory leak from improper handling of non-existant
       windows... this fixes this some... this will be on going

(still here) better support for window groups... i don't know when i'm going to
    ever get to this

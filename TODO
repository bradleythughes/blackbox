-- TODO for Blackbox 0.61.x  - an X11 Window manager

Stuff TODO or On The Way(tm):
-----------------------------
ADD: add _BLACKBOX_STYLE and _BLACKBOX_MENU atoms so that bbtools, bbconf, etc.
     can get the current path to the style in use and menu.

ADD: subdirs in stylesmenu/dir will create a new submenu

CHANGE: when workspace name is greater than the width of its text area the
	toolbar gets very ugly

CHANGE: rework the .blackboxrc resources so that they give a more
        uniform behavior across screens. (Still not sure how I want
	to do this, so it'll have to wait.)

ADD: support for KDE2 via the new WM Spec at
     http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec/

ADD: get volunteers to translate blackbox into other languages

ADD: draw resize frames using the styles borderWidth... should be fairly
     simple to do...

ADD: always on top/bottom support

CHECK: look at why memory usage is up... RSS won't go < 1mb now
       i noticed a memory leak from improper handling of non-existant
       windows... this fixes this some... this will be on going

(still here) better support for window groups... i don't know when i'm going to
    ever get to this

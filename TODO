-- TODO for Blackbox - an X11 Window manager

netwm:
-----------------------------
* if we have N workspaces NET_DESKTOP_NAMES could supply us with N+M
  names.  When we create a new workspace we should consult this list.

* if the wm name changes check if visible name can be removed

refactoring:
-----------------------------
* look into public v. private members of all classes

warts:
-----------------------------
* vnc in full screen mode does not get focus, but apparently works
  with openbox

Stuff TODO or On The Way(tm):
-----------------------------

bt::i18n is very awkward to use - replace it with something else that
can translate into either UTF-8 (needed for NETWM and Xft) or locale
(for Xmb).

ADD: documentation and examples for Rect, since the implementation seems
     to confuse people

ADD: add _BLACKBOX_STYLE and _BLACKBOX_MENU atoms so that bbtools, bbconf,
     etc. can get the current path to the style in use and menu.

ADD: support user controlled window decoration

ADD: subdirs in stylesmenu/dir will create a new submenu

ADD: UTF8 support

CHANGE: when workspace name is greater than the width of its text area the
	toolbar gets very ugly.  Elliding code was recently added for
        the menus, perhaps we should abstract it.

CHANGE: rework the .blackboxrc resources so that they give a more
        uniform behavior across screens. (Still not sure how I want
	to do this, so it'll have to wait.)

ADD: get volunteers to translate blackbox into other languages

ADD: draw resize frames using the styles borderWidth... should be fairly
     simple to do...

ADD: a regression test suite
     items to test:
       *) toggle decor works
       *) multihead

Code cleanup:
-----------------------------
CHANGE: look into the settings stored in client.decorations and
        .functions.

CHANGE: look into centering the window when maximizing and the window can not
        grow to fill the area

ADD: way to have items in menu and store data other than their index number.
     The reason the Send To menu lists every workspace is because if it did
     not blackbox would have no way to know that the one labelled
     "Workspace 2" actually was workspace #2 and was referenced by
     workspace[1]. Something like menu.insert(item, data).

CHANGE: move all of the fprintf() messages to a message function /
        class.  Something like message(WARN, "this is broken") and use
        sprintf() to allow for printf() style replacements.  This can
        be set to go to stderr, a log file, whatever.  It can also be
        disabled for final builds.

CHANGE: use less pointers and more references

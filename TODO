Features I would like to see implemented:
-----------------------------------------
Better support for window groups - like group iconification/closing, etc...
Function access via the menu (this would more than likely entail adding new
  menu tags to access the functions)


Features requested (reasonable):
--------------------------------
Resizing via the handles and/or border.  Sounds like an idea, will have to see
  how feasible it really is.

Features requested (unreasonable):
----------------------------------
Any form of image loading.  This is what ails and bloats too many window
  managers, Blackbox won't ever do this.

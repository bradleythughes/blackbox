-- TODO for Blackbox - an X11 Window manager

Before 0.70.0 release:
-----------------------------

* Fix regressions from 0.65.0

* Fix serious bugs (e.g. crashes) that make Blackbox unusable

* Make sure bstyleconvert properly converts 0.65.0 styles to 0.70.0
  format

* Add code to automatically convert 0.65.0 ~/.blackboxrc to 0.70.0
  format

Stuff TODO or On The Way(tm):
-----------------------------

* i18n/l10n (translations) support, need something else that can
  translate into either UTF-8 (needed for NETWM and Xft) or locale
  (for Xmb).

* make sure transients are correctly associated at startup

* session support via the X session management protocol

* re-add support for tear-off menus to bt::Menu

* see about supporting specifications at www.freedesktop.org (for
  example, the xdg-file location spec)

ADD: add _BLACKBOX_STYLE and _BLACKBOX_MENU atoms so that bbtools, bbconf,
     etc. can get the current path to the style in use and menu.

ADD: support user controlled window decoration

ADD: subdirs in stylesmenu/dir will create a new submenu

ADD: get volunteers to translate blackbox into other languages

ADD: a regression test suite
     items to test:
       *) toggle decor works
       *) multihead

Code cleanup:
-----------------------------

CHANGE: look into centering the window when maximizing and the window can not
        grow to fill the area

CHANGE: move all of the fprintf() messages to a message function /
        class.  Something like message(WARN, "this is broken") and use
        sprintf() to allow for printf() style replacements.  This can
        be set to go to stderr, a log file, whatever.  It can also be
        disabled for final builds.

CHANGE: use less pointers and more references

-- TODO for Blackbox - an X11 Window manager

Before 0.70.0 release:
-----------------------------

* Documentation updates

* Focus Last Window on Workspace

* i18n/l10n (translations) support

netwm:
-----------------------------
* if we have N workspaces NET_DESKTOP_NAMES could supply us with N+M
  names.  When we create a new workspace we should consult this list.

refactoring:
-----------------------------
* look into public v. private members of all classes

Stuff TODO or On The Way(tm):
-----------------------------

* make sure transients are correctly associated at startup

* session support via the X session management protocol

* re-add support for tear-off menus to bt::Menu

* see about supporting specifications at www.freedesktop.org (for
  example, the xdg-file location spec)

bt::i18n is very awkward to use - replace it with something else that
can translate into either UTF-8 (needed for NETWM and Xft) or locale
(for Xmb).

ADD: documentation and examples for Rect, since the implementation seems
     to confuse people

ADD: add _BLACKBOX_STYLE and _BLACKBOX_MENU atoms so that bbtools, bbconf,
     etc. can get the current path to the style in use and menu.

ADD: support user controlled window decoration

ADD: subdirs in stylesmenu/dir will create a new submenu

CHANGE: rework the .blackboxrc resources so that they give a more
        uniform behavior across screens. (Still not sure how I want
	to do this, so it'll have to wait.)

ADD: get volunteers to translate blackbox into other languages

ADD: a regression test suite
     items to test:
       *) toggle decor works
       *) multihead

Code cleanup:
-----------------------------

CHANGE: look into centering the window when maximizing and the window can not
        grow to fill the area

CHANGE: move all of the fprintf() messages to a message function /
        class.  Something like message(WARN, "this is broken") and use
        sprintf() to allow for printf() style replacements.  This can
        be set to go to stderr, a log file, whatever.  It can also be
        disabled for final builds.

CHANGE: use less pointers and more references

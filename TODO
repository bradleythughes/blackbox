-- TODO for Blackbox - an X11 Window manager

CVS Bugs:
-----------------------------
* colour issue under Irix

* acroread transients

CVS warts:
-----------------------------
* transient handling should be properly done for cases where a single toplevel
  has multiple transients... this includes transient stacking
  (partially finished)

* to accomplish the above, we NEED proper window group support... this includes
  supporting group leader, with multiple toplevels which can have multiple
  group transients... with group operations (iconify all, deiconify all,
  send all to workspace, etc.)

* the Xlib manual describes how the X server delivers focus events under
  all situations... generate a visual reference for all these circumstances.
  use this to solve all focusing issues.

Stuff TODO or On The Way(tm):
-----------------------------
ADD: sticky windows are not considered

CHANGE: Send to menu should not list the current workspace
        idea -- we could store the workspace number in the BasemenuItem

CHANGE: look into centering the window when maximizing and the window can not
        grow to fill the area

CHANGE: BlackboxWindow::deiconify needs a new name, also look into show()

ADD: add _BLACKBOX_STYLE and _BLACKBOX_MENU atoms so that bbtools, bbconf, etc.
     can get the current path to the style in use and menu.

ADD: subdirs in stylesmenu/dir will create a new submenu

ADD: UTF8 support

CHANGE: when workspace name is greater than the width of its text area the
	toolbar gets very ugly

CHANGE: rework the .blackboxrc resources so that they give a more
        uniform behavior across screens. (Still not sure how I want
	to do this, so it'll have to wait.)

ADD: support for KDE and GNOME via the new WM Spec at
     http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec/

ADD: get volunteers to translate blackbox into other languages

ADD: draw resize frames using the styles borderWidth... should be fairly
     simple to do...

ADD: always on top/bottom support

ADD: way to empty a menu with one method call something like menu.erase() or
     menu.removeAll()

ADD: way to have items in menu and store data other than their index number.
     The reason the Send To menu lists every workspace is because if it did
     not blackbox would have no way to know that the one labelled "Workspace 2"
     actually was workspace #2 and was referenced by workspace[1].
     something like menu.insert(item, data).

CHANGE: use a Workspace* instead of a number in BlackboxWindow

ADD: a regression test suite
     items to test:
       *) toggle decor works
       *) multihead

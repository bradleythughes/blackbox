Stuff TODO or On The Way(tm):
-----------------------------

Configurable menu "modes"... to select what type of indicators the menus use
    (e.g. square/box, triangle, circle)
Balancing SnapTo/EdgeResistance - this is a complicated idea to explain...
    don't ask :)
abstraction of BImage and BImageControl (this let's people like John Kennis
    update to the newer image code a little easier)... this would also involve
    creating a generic class for X display "control"...
rework/rewrite the focus handling code... i don't like the way i'm doing it
    at the moment... and with blackbox approaching it's 2nd birthday... i'm
    a little wiser when it comes to how focus events are generated
(still here) better support for window groups... i don't know when i'm going to
    ever get to this

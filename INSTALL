Compilation and Installation:
--------------------------------
   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory in the
Blackbox source tree.

Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that you can run
in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile Blackbox, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to bhughes@tcac.net so they can be considered
for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache' contains
results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'. 


Compilers and Options:
----------------------
   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure


Optional Features:
------------------
   Blackbox supports the XShape extension of X11R6.  This support
is enabled by default, but may be overridden by specifying
`--enable-shape' on the configure script's command line.

Also, `configure' can usually find the X include and library files
automatically, but if it doesn't, you can use the `configure'
options `--x-includes=DIR' and `--x-libraries=DIR' to specify
their locations.


Please read the README file also.

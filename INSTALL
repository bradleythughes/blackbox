I would also like to thank the creators of WindowMaker.  Reading the existing
code has helped me immensely, and the BImage class follows the RImage data type
very closely (the 8bpp code and dithering code was based off of WindowMaker's
wrlib).


Compilation and Installation:
--------------------------------
Blackbox uses an Imakefile to better configure and allow for various
system types.  Compiler flags, libraries and paths are automatically set
in the various imake rules and templates files.

Edit Imakefile, lib/Imakefile and src/Imakefile to #define the options that
you want compiled into (or out of) blackbox.

To fully compile and install blackbox, issue the following commands:
	xmkmf -a
	make
	make install (as root, for permissions)

Each user should edit their appropriate .xinitrc or .xsession files to
use the newly installed blackbox executable file.

Please read the README file.

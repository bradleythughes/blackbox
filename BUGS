0.62.0pre2:
  launching blackbox sometimes causes clients to disappear -- they are not
    icons nor are they mapped.  Opening new windows seems to take the hidden
    window into account.  It is most odd.

  restarting bb causes it to lose the settings on existing windows -- they
    are no longer iconified or on the right workspace

  vertical maximization moves the window and does not quite reach the toolbar

  sylpheed crashes, again!@!

  need better argument parsing --display goes though unchecked

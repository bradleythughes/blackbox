-- data/README for Blackbox - an X11 Window manager

The data/ directory holds some menu and style (or theme) examples for
Blackbox.


The styles are installed as system defaults, and are ALWAYS
overwritten when upgrading or otherwise re-installing Blackbox.
Changes to them are discouraged, because of this reason.

In the data/ directory, you will find a directory named `styles.'
These are the system defaults that are installed when Blackbox is
built, and they are intended as examples on how to customize and
control the appearance of Blackbox.  In the event that a user does not
have a defined style, Blackbox falls back on the example styles
included here.

Also in the data/ directory is a file named `menu'.  This is meant as
an example but is also installed if make install detects that no menu
exists.  If blackbox is ever started without a valid menu the user
will get a backup menu which gives the ability to launch and xterm and
exit the window manager.

For information on creating/editing a menu, see the file README.menu.
For information on creating/editing a style, see the file
README.style.

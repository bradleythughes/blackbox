This README file covers the two controlling files for Blackbox.

In this directory, there are two files.
	menu
	rc

rc
-----------
This is the template for each users ~/.blackboxrc.  This file should NOT be
copied to ~/.blackboxrc, as Blackbox writes this file itself, saving various
data that is restored the next time Blackbox is run.

menu
----------------
This is the default menu file for Blackbox. Changes are also welcome, but a
user defined menu file is the more sane approach, as not all users will have
access to all the functions/programs/etc. that may be placed in the global menu
file.

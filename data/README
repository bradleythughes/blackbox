The data/ directory holds some menu and style (or theme) examples for Blackbox.
These are installed as system defaults, and are ALWAYS overwritten when
upgrading or otherwise re-installing Blackbox.  Changes to them are
discouraged, because of this reason.

In the data/ directory, you will find a file named `menu' and a directory
named `styles.'  These are the system defaults that are installed when
Blackbox is built, and they are intended as examples on how to customize and
control the appearance of Blackbox.  In the event that a user does not have
a defined menu and/or style, Blackbox falls back on the example menu and/or
styles included here.

For information on creating/editing a menu, see the file README.menu.

For information on creating/editing a style, see the file README.style.

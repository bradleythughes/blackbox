-- data/README for Blackbox - an X11 Window manager

The data/ directory holds some menu and style (or theme) examples for Blackbox.


The styles are installed as system defaults, and are ALWAYS overwritten when
upgrading or otherwise re-installing Blackbox.  Changes to them are
discouraged, because of this reason.

In the data/ directory, you will find a directory named `styles.'  These are
the system defaults that are installed when Blackbox is built, and they are
intended as examples on how to customize and control the appearance of
Blackbox.
In the event that a user does not have a defined style, Blackbox falls back on
the example styles included here.

Also in the data/ directory is a file named `menu'. This file is not installed
with Blackbox, but is an example of a menu file that can be edited to simply
create a custom menu. If the user does not have a defined menu, Blackbox falls
back on a small, simple internal menu.

For information on creating/editing a menu, see the file README.menu.

For information on creating/editing a style, see the file README.style.

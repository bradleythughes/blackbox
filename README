This is the README for Blackbox 0.40.x Beta release.

The source tree for Blackbox is comprised of three subdirectories:

	data/		- this holds the default data files that Blackbox
			  requires for proper operation
	src/		- this holds the actual C++ source code for the window
			  manager.
	util/		- this holds source code for small utility programs
			  that help Blackbox doing what it does best.

Included utilities:
-------------------
Currently, the only included utility is a program named bsetroot, which is a
replacement for xsetroot.  Operation of bsetroot is almost the same as
xsetroot, minus a few options.  The difference between xsetroot and bsetroot
is that bsetroot has been coded for multiple screens (e.g. multi-headed
displays), where as the stock xsetroot is not.

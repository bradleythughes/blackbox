-- README for Blackbox - an X11 Window manager

This is the README for Blackbox 0.62.x release.

The source tree for Blackbox is comprised of five subdirectories:

	data/		- this holds the default data files that Blackbox
                          requires for proper operation

	doc/		- this holds the documentation files that explain
	                  the various aspects of Blackbox

	nls/		- this holds the message files used to generate
			  message catalogs for different languages

	src/		- this holds the actual C++ source code for the window
			  manager.

	util/		- this holds source code for small utility programs
			  that help Blackbox do what it does best.


Quick Start:
------------
The quickest and easiest way to get Blackbox up and running is to run the
following commands:

# cd blackbox-version
# ./configure
# make
# su -c 'make install'

This will configure, compile and install Blackbox the quickest.  For those
who like to spend the extra 15 seconds reading ./configure --help, some
compile time options can be turned on and off before the build.

For general information on GNU's ./configure, see the file INSTALL.


Configuring Blackbox:
---------------------
The next thing most users want to do after installing Blackbox is to configure
the colors, fonts, menus, etc. to their liking.  This is covered by the files
data/README, data/README.menu and data/README.style.  These files give
detailed information on how to customize your new window manager.


Included utilities:
-------------------
Currently, the only included utilities are a program named bsetroot and a
script called bsetbg. bsetroot is a replacement for xsetroot, minus a few
options.  The difference between xsetroot and bsetroot is that bsetroot has
been coded for multiple screens (e.g. multi-headed displays), where as the
stock xsetroot is not. The bsetbg script acts as a wrapper for most of the
popular programs used to set background pixmaps, making it possible
for styles to provide a machine-independent rootCommand.


Third-party utilities:
----------------------
With the start of the 0.60.x series Blackbox no longer handles any
keyboard shortcuts; instead it supports a communication protocol which
allows other programs to handle these and related tasks. If you'd like
to be able to use keyboard shortcuts with Blackbox, bbkeys (available at
http://http://bbkeys.sourceforge.net) can provide you with all the previous
functionality and more.
If you're looking for a GUI with which to configure your blackbox menu and/or
styles, check out http://bbconf.sourceforge.net. bbconf is a QT program that
does just that, as well as providing a GUI for editing your keybindings for the
above mentioned bbkeys.

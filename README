This is the README for Blackbox 0.40.x Beta release. There are a number of
changes between this release and the last stable release, 0.35.0.

Many things have changed for Blackbox 0.40.x, which will be covered in this 
file.  First of all, the lib/ subdirectory has been removed, as the small
applet library is now defunct and at this point unsupported.

Second, the configuration system has changed radically.  Configuring Blackbox
is now controlled by 3 different files; see the app-defaults/ directory for
details.

NOTE: As part of the new configuration system, blackbox now saves it's own
configuration file (~/.blackboxrc) upon exiting or restarting.  This means that
editing this file shouldn't be necessary, except to change the menu file or
other file locations.  First time users need only run blackbox once and
then exit, at which point blackbox will write a new ~/.blackboxrc, which can
be edited by hand, or changed by operating blackbox (i.e. adding or removing
workspaces will cause blackbox to write the changes, as well as the current
style file and the stack order of the toolbar).

This is the README for Blackbox 0.51.x release.

The source tree for Blackbox is comprised of three subdirectories:

	data/		- this holds the default data files that Blackbox
			  requires for proper operation
	src/		- this holds the actual C++ source code for the window
			  manager.
	util/		- this holds source code for small utility programs
			  that help Blackbox doing what it does best.


Quick Start:
------------
The quickest and easiest way to get Blackbox up and running is to run the
following commands:

# cd blackbox-0.51.x
# ./configure
# make
# su -c 'make install'

This will configure, compile and install Blackbox the quickest.  For those
who like to spend the extra 15 seconds reading ./configure --help, some
compile time options can be turned on and off before the build.

For general information on GNU's ./configure, see the file INSTALL.


Configuring Blackbox:
---------------------
The next thing most users want to do after installing Blackbox is to configure
the colors, fonts, menus, etc. to their liking.  This is covered by the files
data/README, data/README.menu and data/README.style.  These files give
detailed information on how to customize your new window manager.


Included utilities:
-------------------
Currently, the only included utility is a program named bsetroot, which is a
replacement for xsetroot.  Operation of bsetroot is almost the same as
xsetroot, minus a few options.  The difference between xsetroot and bsetroot
is that bsetroot has been coded for multiple screens (e.g. multi-headed
displays), where as the stock xsetroot is not.


Supported Platforms:
--------------------
ix86-Linux 2.0.x (libc5 and glibc2)
ix86-Linux 2.1.x (libc5 and glibc2)
ix86-Linux 2.2.x (glibc2)
ix86-Linux 2.3.x (glibc2.1)
ix86-FreeBSD 4.0-current
ix86-FreeBSD 3.2-{stable,release} (development platform)
ix86-FreeBSD 3.1-{stable,release}
ix86-FreeBSD 2.2.x-stable
ix86-NetBSD 1.3.3
ix86-BSDi 4.0
PPC-Linux R5 (aka linuxppc 1999)
ix86-Solaris 2.6
Sparc-Solaris 2.6 (2.5 anyone?)
Sparc-Solaris 2.7
ix86-Solaris 7 (== 2.7?)
Alpha-Digital UNIX 4.0D
Alpha-Linux 2.2.x
rs6k-AIX 4.1.3
rs6k-AIX 4.3.2
MIPS-IRIX 6.5 (requires gcc, MIPSpro didn't like some of the template-fu)
ix86-OS/2 (version? recent successes?)
hp9000/715-HP/UX 10.20 (with egcs 1.1.1)

NOTE: OS/2 support was included sometime in the 0.40.x series, but I have lost
      touch with the person that contributed the patches.  The code is still in
      place, but I don't know if 0.51.x still runs on this platform.

UPDATE: A report has been confirmed that 0.51.x doesn't run on OS/2 with out
        some work.  This has to do with lack of a getitimer(3) function.
        Currently, getitimer(3) is used for auto raising, and is due for 
        replacement sometime soon.

Please email bhughes@tcac.net for other success reports.

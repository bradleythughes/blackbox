This is the README for Blackbox 0.50.x Beta release.

The source tree for Blackbox is comprised of three subdirectories:

	data/		- this holds the default data files that Blackbox
			  requires for proper operation
	src/		- this holds the actual C++ source code for the window
			  manager.
	util/		- this holds source code for small utility programs
			  that help Blackbox doing what it does best.

Included utilities:
-------------------
Currently, the only included utility is a program named bsetroot, which is a
replacement for xsetroot.  Operation of bsetroot is almost the same as
xsetroot, minus a few options.  The difference between xsetroot and bsetroot
is that bsetroot has been coded for multiple screens (e.g. multi-headed
displays), where as the stock xsetroot is not.

Supported Platforms:
--------------------
ix86-Linux 2.0.x (libc5 and glibc2)
ix86-Linux 2.1.x (libc5 and glibc2 - development platform)
ix86-FreeBSD 3.0-current (w/ elf kernel! -lukin)
ix86-FreeBSD 2.2.x-stable
PPC-mkLinux (version?)
Sparc-Solaris 2.6 (2.5 anyone?)
ix86-Solaris 7 (== 2.7?)
Alpha-Digital UNIX (version?)
?-AIX (rs6k? version?)
MIPS-IRIX 6.5 (requires gcc, MIPSpro didn't like some of the template-fu)
ix86-OS/2 (version? recent successes?)

NOTE: OS/2 support was included sometime in the 0.40.x series, but I have lost
      touch with the person that contributed the patches.  The code is still in
      place, but I don't know if 0.50.x still runs on this platform.

Please email bhughes@tcac.net for other success reports.

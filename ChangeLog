-- ChangeLog for Blackbox 0.70.x

Changes from 0.65.x to 0.70.0:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a major update resulting from a long development cycle... the
list below is a general list and does not cover all changes in detail.

  - introduced a utility library (libbt) for aiding in writing
    small blackbox oriented applications
  - all menus are now proper popup menus, with keyboard navigation
  - complete EWMH support
  - Xft support has been added to support anti-aliased fonts
  - support for texture borders has been added... any texture can now
    have a border of arbitrary width and color
  - ~/.blackboxrc is no longer written on exit or restart.  Instead it
    is written whenever a change is made.  This means the rc can be
    edited while Blackbox is running (finally).
  - support for always-on-top and always-on-bottom has been added
  - support for fullscreen windows has been added
  - support for all EWMH window types has been added (e.g. desktop
    windows, dock windows, dialogs, etc.)
  - support for window groups has been added
  - support for transient windows has been improved
  - it is now possible to completely disable the toolbar
  - when the toolbar and slit are no longer in use, they are
    destroyed... they will be recreated when needed
  - the style file format has changed.  a new utility, bstyleconvert,
    can be used to convert older 0.65.0 styles to the 0.70.0 format
  - the format of ~/.blackboxrc has changed.  Blackbox will
    automatically convert to the new format.
  - both the look and feel have been updated, feedback is encouraged

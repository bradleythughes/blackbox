ChangeLog for 0.61.x


Changes from 0.60.3 to 0.61.0:
  - Added slightly updated copies of the blackbox/bsetroot manpages.
  - Reworked the Windowmenu code so that using the second mouse
    button on the Send To menu moves you along with the window
  - Merged in bsd-snprintf.(h|c) from openssh so that Blackbox can
    compile on older boxes without (v)snprintf in their standard lib.
  - fixed a pair of problems where blackbox was not returning icons
    and slit apps to a useable state at shutdown
  - fixed a problem with menus not getting layered correctly after
    a reconfigure or menu reload
  - Changed the behavior of the various MOD1+ButtonPresses on windows...
    they should now be more consistent with the button behavior on the
    decorations :
            . MOD1+Button1 raises and moves the window (unchanged)
	    . MOD1+Button2 lowers the window (used to resize the window)
	    . MOD1+Button3 resizes the window (new button combo)
  - fixed a small but _extremely_ annoying bug exposed by cvsup
  - styled frames are now a thing of the past... the textures formerly
    known as window.frame.(un)focus have been replaced by solid colors
    window.frame.(un)focusColor... the thickness of the frame is now
    determined by frameWidth, which will default to bevelWidth if not
    specified
  - middle clicking on a window in a workspace's window list now moves
    the window to the current workspace
  - fixed a minor glitch with the appearance of window labels for
    certain newly-started apps (i.e. rxvt)
  - added a new configure option for both the toolbar and the slit --
    autohide. Hopefully this should help quell the demands for the
    removal of the toolbar...
  - added code to better handle apps that change the window focus
  - changed the command execution code (used to handle rootCommands
    and executable menu items) to be more robust... compound commands
    should now work
  - a new-and-slightly-improved implementation of unstyled frames should
    mean slightly better performance than previously
  - fixed a couple of stupid bugs in the new code for handling
    Solid Flat textures more efficiently
  - fixed the nls makefiles so that they respect DESTDIR, behave better
    if you reinstall over an existing installation, and actually remove
    their files on a make uninstall
  - added cthulhain's bsetbg script to the util directory... see the
    file README.bsetbg for more information
  - added Estonian, French and Danish translations

-- ChangeLog for Blackbox 0.70.x

Changes from 0.70.0 to 0.70.1:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - fix compilation on OpenBSD and Mac OS X
  - documentation updates to data/README.menu
  - fix bt::Timer to make sure it still works after daylight-savings
    changes
  - fix horizontal text alignment by adding a small indent to all text
  - fix sunken gradient rendering: the colors are no longer inverted,
    and the correct bevel is drawn
  - add bt::XDG::BaseDir, which is an implementation of the
    freedesktop.org basedir-spec version 0.6
  - make bt::Pen able to recover from cache faults
  - silence messages from bt::PixmapCache about the cache maximum
    being exceeded
  - add bt::Rect::inside(), which ensures that one rectangle is inside
    the other
  - fix bt::Resource to do nothing if filename arguments are empty
  - fix bt::Resource::merge() to stop overriding existing entries (it
    should only add new ones)
  - add bt::Texture::textureResource() overload that returns a default
    texture if the resource cannot be found
  - add bt::dirname(), which returns the directory part of a file path
  - add bt::mkdirhier(), which is equivalent to
    'mkdir -m mode -p path'
  - add bt::tolower(), which returns a string with all characters
    lowercase
  - add the "Center Placement" window placement policy, which places
    all new windows in the center of the screen
  - add "Shade Window with Mouse Wheel" and "Toolbar Actions with
    Mouse Wheel" configuration options
  - add window-to-window snapping support. This feature is off by
    default, you need to set session.windowSnapThreshold to a positive
    number in your ~/.blackboxrc.
  - add support for piped menus. The output of a command can be used
    to create the blackbox menu. This is done by prepending the pipe
    character, |, to session.menuFile in ~/.blackboxrc or to [include]
    filenames.
  - [nop] menu entries are now drawn disabled
  - fix "Focus Last Window on Workspace" behavior to stop preferring
    windows that occupy all workspaces
  - window placement takes windows with Desktop and Dialog types into
    consideration and does the appropriate thing (instead of placing
    them normally)
  - remove 1 pixel gaps between windows when doing smart placement
  - allow users to override the style's rootCommand in their
    ~/.blackboxrc
  - fix default colors used by blackbox when no style is found
  - allow the Toolbar to be raised and lowered with
    Alt+LeftMouseButton and Alt+MiddleMouseButton, respectively
  - fix maximized+shaded windows from disappearing when restarting
    blackbox
  - each window's windowmenu can be accessed now with
    Mod4+RightMouseButton
  - fix fullscreen support to ignore aspect ratios set by applications
    (specifically, this should fix movie players that are currently
    displaying 16:9 video on a 4:3 screen)
  - fix support for _NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW, normally sent from pagers
  - fix focus problems caused by applications that try to fake
    fullscreen by setting focus to an override-redirect window
    (e.g. rdekstop)

Changes from 0.65.x to 0.70.0:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a major update resulting from a long development cycle... the
list below is a general list and does not cover all changes in detail.

  - introduced a utility library (libbt) for aiding in writing
    small blackbox oriented applications
  - all menus are now proper popup menus, with keyboard navigation
  - complete EWMH support
  - Xft support has been added to support anti-aliased fonts
  - support for texture borders has been added... any texture can now
    have a border of arbitrary width and color
  - ~/.blackboxrc is no longer written on exit or restart.  Instead it
    is written whenever a change is made.  This means the rc can be
    edited while Blackbox is running (finally).
  - support for always-on-top and always-on-bottom has been added
  - support for fullscreen windows has been added
  - support for all EWMH window types has been added (e.g. desktop
    windows, dock windows, dialogs, etc.)
  - support for window groups has been added
  - support for transient windows has been improved
  - it is now possible to completely disable the toolbar
  - when the toolbar and slit are no longer in use, they are
    destroyed... they will be recreated when needed
  - the style file format has changed.  a new utility, bstyleconvert,
    can be used to convert older 0.65.0 styles to the 0.70.0 format
  - the format of ~/.blackboxrc has changed.  Blackbox will
    automatically convert to the new format.
  - both the look and feel have been updated, feedback is encouraged

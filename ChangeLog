ChangeLog for Blackbox 0.50.xx
Enjoy! :)

Changes from 0.50.0 to 0.50.1:
  - eliminated the need for XConvertCase... workspace editing should now print
    any and all characters correctly
  - added check for libgen.h (which provides the prototype for basename() on
    some systems, like OpenBSD)
  - some code obfuscation (i've been removing comments, as some of them don't
    relate to some of the code below them... i plan on recommenting the code
    some time soon)
  - clicking button 3 will hide ANY menu now, and in the case of the workspace
    and or client menus, any other menus and/or buttons associated will be
    closed as well
  - added a patch for multi-screen which sets the DISPLAY env variable so that
    items selected from one screen don't show up on another... many thanks to
    F Harvell <fharvell@fts.net> for this
  - fixed a clock bug... again thanks to F Harvell for this one
  - complete and proper window placement and window restore has been
    implemented... windows that are partially off screen will be placed in the
    center of the root window
  - the toolbar's workspace label is now dynamically sized according to the
    length of the workspace names
  - as stated above... workspace name editing has been completely redone, i
    discovered XLookupString() this weekend and have deemed it the function of
    the week... any and all characters should be printed properly now
  - window placement now has it's own resource...
    session.screen<NUM>.windowPlacement which may be set to SmartPlacement
    (which has been implemented) or anything else to default back to cascade
    placement
  - a new resource, session.screen<NUM>.toolbarWidthPercent has been added, and
    should be set to an integer representing what percentage of the root window
    width the toolbar should occupy (default has been changed back to 67)


Changes from 0.40.14 to 0.50.0:
  - added util/ subdirectory to place small, utility programs to use in
    conjunction with blackbox.
  - updated the README... it's still vague and useless, but gives a better
    view of whats going on
  - the configure script now checks for a few more headers, setlocale and
    strftime in addition to basename functions to better include support for
    multiple arch/langs/etc.
  - updated default menu file... made it a little more general... and made
    the default style menu [include]'d instead of explicitly included...
    this break off of the style menu allows for custom menus to include the
    default style menu for a create selection of styles
  - changed all the default styles to use bsetroot instead of xsetroot
  - menu handling has been improved... no more than one menu at a time may be
    visible on the desktop (save for the root menu and it's tear off menus)
    this means that you can't have multiple window menus and the workspace menu
    open all at once... which saves screen space and reduces clutter
  - much of the code has been reorganzied and reformatted for better
    readability... this consists of function name changes and function
    "ownership" (which basically means workspaces aren't managed by the toolbar
    itself anymore, but by a general screen class on which the toolbar can
    operate)
  - the workspacemenu now autohides when selecting a window from one of the
    window lists
  - removed many empty destructors for Basemenu subclasses to improve code
    readability
  - two new files, Screen.cc and Screen.hh, have been added to the distribution
    they add the new class BScreen which was needed for the biggest change of
    the Blackbox code base, the addition of multiple screen (i.e. multihead)
    support.  A separate BScreen is created for each screen, and all screens
    work inconjunction with the other... windows can't be passed between
    screens, because the X server doesn't allow this (more investigation on
    this later)
  - the toolbar's clock format is now controlled by the strftime() function...
    if configure can't find this function on your system, the old date/time
    format is used... with strftime, clicking on the clock doesn't display the
    date... as the date may now be part of the clock display... read the man
    page for the strftime function to write a format string for your clock,
    and place it in .blackboxrc (i.e.
      session.strftimeFormat: %I:%M %p on %a, %b %d is my strftime format
    string)
  - the toolbar has been stripped of it's workspace responsibilities, but this
    change has no effect on the end user.
  - common code interspersed through out the code has been consolodated into
    small functions and called multiple times instead of having the same or
    similar code repeated in the same class
  - the window startup code has been improved upon again so that shaded windows
    are restored between restarts
  - some ICCCM code has been updated to properly reflect the state of windows
    while shaded or on different workspaces... this state code change should
    also fix the JX toolkit problem of deiconifying and nothing being redrawn
  - the main Blackbox class has been changed to purely handle X events... it
    doesn't manage resources (save for those necessary for proper event
    handling, like the focus model for each screen)
  - the format of .blackboxrc has changed slightly, the session.menuFile,
    session.doubleClickInterval, session.imageDither, session.styleFile,
    and session.colorsPerChannel resources are unchanged.  However, the
    following resources are screen dependant:

	session.screen<num>.strftimeFormat
	session.screen<num>.workspaces
	session.screen<num>.workspaceNames
	session.screen<num>.toolbarRaised
	session.screen<num>.focusModel

    where <num> is the screen number (zero being default and all that would be
    present on a single screen/monitor setup).
  - a utility named bsetroot (mentioned above) has been included in the
    blackbox distribution, to aid in setting root window patterns (ala
    xsetroot).  the only different between xsetroot and bsetroot is that
    bsetroot doesn't redefine cursors, and doesn't restore defaults if no
    arguments are given.  bsetroot does support multiple screens, and is ideal
    for those setups (instead of running xsetroot for each screen)

Changelog for 0.70.x

Changes from 0.65.x to 0.70.0
  - moved utility classes into a library
  - beginnings of netwm implementation
  - blackboxrc is no longer written on exit or restart.  Instead it is
    written whenever a change is made.  This means the rc can be
    edited while Blackbox is running (finally).

.SH DESCRIPTION
Bsetroot is a utility that can control the appearance of the root window in
three ways: Either give it a solid color, or write a two color modula pattern
to it, or render a gradient texture, based on two different colors.
.PP
Bsetroot resembles
.IR xsetroot (1)
in this functionality but it supports multiple screen displays, and gradient
textures the same way as Blackbox does.
It doesn't handle cursors etc.
Bsetroot is part of the Blackbox package.

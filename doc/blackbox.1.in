.SH NAME
blackbox \- a window manager for X11
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR blackbox " \-help | \-version"
.br
.B blackbox 
.RI "[ \-rc" " rcfile " "] [ \-display" " display " ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"
.\" Phirst Phew ParagraPhs taken from blackbox.alug.org
.\"
Blackbox is yet another addition to the list of window managers for the Open
Group's X Window System, Version 11 Release 6 and above.
Blackbox is built with C++, sharing no common code with any other window
manager (even though the graphics implementation is similar to that of Window
Maker).
.PP
From the time the first line of code was written, Blackbox has evolved around
one premise, minimalism.
It's not meant to be Eye Candy, nor the most Featureful, nor the most Adorned
for modelling the Widely acclaimed NeXT interface.
It is just meant to be
.BR fast .
.PP
Blackbox provides configurable window decorations, a root menu to launch
applications and a toolbar that shows the current workspace name, the focused
application name and the current time.
There is also a workspace menu to add or remove workspaces. The `slit' can be
used to dock small applications, e.g. most of the bbtools can use the slit.
.PP
Blackbox features a special kind of icon handling: When you minimize a window,
no icon appears; instead you can view all minimized applications in the `Icons'
submenu of the workspace menu.
Your desktop will never get cluttered with icons. As an alternative to icons
shaded windows are provided: A double click on the titlebar of a window will
shade it (i.e. the window will disappear, only the titlebar stays visible.)
.PP
Blackbox uses its own graphics class to render its images on the fly.
By using style files, you can determine at a great level how your desktop looks
like.
Currently KDE WM hints are not supported, but Blackbox is already prepared to
support the new window manager specification that is now being developed for
both Gnome and KDE2.0.
.SH OPTIONS
Blackbox supports the following commandline options:
.TP
.B \-help
Display command line options and compiled-in features, then exit.
.TP
.B \-version
Display version info and exit.
.TP
.BI \-rc \ rcfile
Use another rcfile than the default
.IR  "~/.blackboxrc" .
.TP
.BI \-display \ display
Start Blackbox on the specified display.
Programs started by Blackbox will have the
.B DISPLAY
environment variable set to this value, too.
.SH RUNNING BLACKBOX
This program is usually started by the user's startup script, most times called
.IR ~/.xinitrc .
To run blackbox, modify the script by adding
.EX 0
exec blackbox
.EE
as the last executed command of the script.
When Blackbox terminates, the X session will terminate too.
.PP
When started, Blackbox will try to find a default menufile in
.IR @pkgdatadir@/menu .
You can provide a system-wide menu for your users here.
.PP
On exit or restart, Blackbox will save user defaults in the file
.I ~/.blackboxrc
in the user's home directory.
Some resources in this file can be edited by hand.
.SH USING BLACKBOX
From version 0.60.x, Blackbox does no keyboard handling by itself; instead it
relies on an external program
.IR bbkeys (1)
for this.
So in this section we will discuss all mouse commands.
.SS Root window (background):
Right click (button 3) will pop up the root menu.
With this you can launch your applications.
You can customize this menu for your needs.
A middle click (button 2) pops up the workspace menu.
You can add or remove a workspace, view
applications running on all workspace, inspect your icons, and jump directly to
any workspace or application.
.SS Toolbar:
The toolbar consists of three fields: a workspace name, window name of the
window that has currently focus, and a clock.
A left click (button 1) on the toolbar will bring it to the foreground, a
middle click will hide it behind other windows (if AlwaysOnTop is not set), and
the right button brings up a little menu.
.PP
Using this menu you can enter a name for the current workspace (when finished,
press Enter).
Also you can choose the toolbar's position, and whether or not it
should be always on top (i.e. it cannot be obscured by other windows).
.PP
Note: In Blackbox versions below 0.60.0, a right click on the toolbar
immediately enters workspace name edit mode.
.SS Window Titlebar and Borders:
A left click on any place of the window's border, will raise it.
Dragging then moves the window.
Dragging the resize grips at the left-bottom and right-bottom
corners resizes the window.
Middle clicking on any place will immediately lower the window.
Right clicking on border or titlebar pops up the window menu,
containing these commands:
.TP
.B Send To...
Send window to another workspace
.TP
.B Shade
Shade the window (display titlebar only)
.TP
.B Iconify
Iconify window.
The `icon' can be found in the `Icons' submenu of the workspace menu
.TP
.B Maximize
(Un)Maximize window.
When you click the middle button on this item, the
window will maximize only vertically
.TP
.B Raise
Raise window
.TP
.B Lower
Lower window
.TP
.B Stick
(Un)Stick window.
A stuck window will always be displayed in the current workspace
.TP
.B Kill Client
Kill (-SIGKILL) owner of window
.TP
.B Close
Close the application cleanly
.PP
When you doubleclick on the titlebar of a window, it will `shade', so
that only the titlebar stays visible.
Another double click will redisplay the window contents.
.SS Window Buttons:
The button at the left upper corner of a window is the Minimize button.
Clicking with any button causes the window to be iconified.
The rightmost button (with the X) closes the application.
The other button on the right (if present) maximizes the window in three ways:
Button 1 causes full screen maximization, button 2 maximizes the window only
vertically, and button 3 only horizontally.
.SS Any menu:
Clicking button 3 in a menu will popdown the menu.
Clicking button 1 on the titlebar of any (sub)menu and then dragging it somewhere
else will cause the menu to stay visible and not disappear when you click on
a menu item.
.SS Miscellaneous:
When you want to drag a window, but cannot see either the bottom handle or its
titlebar, you can press Alt + button 1 anywhere in the window and then
drag it around.
You can also use Alt + button 1 to raise a partially visible window.
.SH MENU FILE
A default menu file is installed in
.IR @pkgdatadir@/menu .
Of course this system-wide menu can be customized for all users at once.
But it is also possible to create a personal menu.
It is a convention to create a directory
.IR "~/.blackbox/" " (or " "~/blackbox/" ")"
in your home directory, and to create a menu file, e.g.
.I menu
in this directory, or copy the system-wide menu file to this location.
Next, we have to tell Blackbox to load our menu file instead of the default.
This is accomplished by adding (or changing) a resource value in the
.I ~/.blackboxrc
file e.g.:
.EX
session.menuFile:       ~/.blackbox/menu
.EE
For this change to take effect, Blackbox has to be restarted.
Be sure that your menu is usable, then choose `Restart' from the default
Blackbox root menu.
.SS Menu syntax
The menu syntax is very simple and very effective.
There are upto three fields in a menu line.
They are of the form:
.EX
[tag] (label or filename) {command or filename}
.EE
The supported tags are as follows:
.TP
.B [begin] (label for root menu)
This tells Blackbox to start parsing the menu file.
This tag is required for Blackbox to parse your menu file.
If it cannot find it, the system default menu is used instead.
.TP
.B [end]
This tells Blackbox that it is at the end of a menu.
This can either be a submenu or the main root menu.
There must be at least one of these tags in your menu to correspond to the
required [begin] tag.
.TP
.B [exec] (label for command) {shell command}
Inserts a command item into the menu.
When you select the menu item from the menu, Blackbox runs `shell command.'
.TP
.B [exit] (label for exit)
Inserts an item that shuts down and exits Blackbox.
Any open windows are reparented to the root window before Blackbox exits.
.TP
.B [include] (filename)
Parses the file specified by
.I filename
inline with the
current menu. The filename can be the full path to a file or it can begin with
.IR ~/ ,
which will be expanded into your home directory (e.g.
.EX
[include] (~/blackbox/stylesmenu)
.EE
will include
.I /home/bhughes/blackbox/stylesmenu
in my menu).
.TP
.B [nop] (label - optional)
Insert a non-operational item into the current menu.
This can be used to help format the menu into blocks or sections
if so desired.
.B [nop]
does accept a label, but it is not required, and a blank item will be used
if none is supplied.
.TP 
.B [style] (label) {filename}
This tells Blackbox to insert an item that, when selected, reads style file
named
.I filename
and apply the new textures, colors and fonts to the current
running session.
.TP
.B [stylesdir] (directory name)
Reads all filenames from the specified directory, assuming that they are all
valid style files (directories are ignored), and creates menu items in the
current menu for every filename, that, when selected by the user, apply the
selected style file to the current session.
The labels that are created in the menu are the filenames of the style files.
.TP
.B [stylesmenu] (label) {directory name}
Creates a submenu entry with
.I label 
(that is also the title of the new submenu), and inserts in that submenu all
filenames in the specified directory, assuming that they are all valid style
files (directories are ignored) in the same way as the
.B [stylesdir]
command does.
.IP
.RB Both\  [stylesdir] \ and\  [stylesmenu]
commands make it possible to install style files without editing your menu file.
.TP
.B [submenu] (label) {title for menu - optional}
This tells Blackbox to create and parse a new menu.
This menu is inserted as a submenu into the parent menu.
These menus are parsed recursively, so there is no limit to the number of levels
or nested submenus you can have.
The title for the new menu is optional, if none is supplied,
the new menu's title is the same as the item label.
An
.B [end]
tag is required to end the submenu.
.TP
.B [reconfig] (label)
When selected, this item rereads the current style and menu files and
apply any changes.
This is useful for creating a new style or theme, as you don't have to
constantly restart Blackbox every time you save your style.
However, Blackbox automagically rereads the menu whenever it changes.
.TP
.B [restart] (label) {shell command - optional}
This tells Blackbox to restart.
If `shell command' is supplied, it shuts down and runs the command (which is
commonly the name of another window manager).
If the command is omitted, Blackbox restarts itself.
.TP
.B [config] (label)
Inserts a Blackbox native submenu item, containing numerous configuration
options concerning window placement, focus style, window moving style etc.
.TP
.B [workspaces] (label)
This tells Blackbox to insert a link to the workspaces menu directly
into your menu.
This is handy for those users who can't access the
workspace menu directly (e.g. if you don't have a 3 button mouse, it's
rather hard to middle click to show the workspace menu).
.PP
Any line that starts with a `#' is considered a comment and ignored by Blackbox.
Also, in the labels/commands/filenames fields,
you can escape any character like so:
.EX
[exec] (\\(my cool\\) \\{XTERM\\}) {xterm -T \\"cool XTERM\\"}
.EE
Using `\\\\' inserts a literal back-slash into the label/command/filename field.
.SS Menu example
Now let's put together some things.
Here is a short example of a menu file:
.PP
.nf
# Blackbox menu file
[begin] (Blackbox 0.60.3)
  [exec] (rxvt) {rxvt -ls}
  [exec] (netscape) {netscape -install}
  [exec] (The GIMP) {gimp}
  [exec] (XV) {xv}
  [submenu] (pine)
    [exec] (inbox) {rxvt -name pine -e pine -i}
    [exec] (new message) {rxvt -name pine -e pine ""}
  [end]
  [submenu] (Window Manager)
    [exec] (Edit Menus) {nedit .blackbox/Menu}
    [submenu] (Style) {Which Style?}
      [stylesdir] (~/.blackbox/Styles)
      [stylesmenu] (Blackbox Styles) {@pkgdatadir@/styles}
    [end]
    [config] (Config Options)
    [reconfig] (Reconfigure)
    [restart] (Restart)
  [end]
  [exit] (Log Out)
[end]
# end of menu file
.fi
.SH STYLES
Blackbox enables you to use specialized files that contain
.IR X (1)
resources to specify colors, textures and fonts, and thus
the overall look of your window borders, menus and the toolbar.
.PP
The default installation of Blackbox provides some of these style files.
Usually they are put in
.IR @pkgdatadir@/styles .
You can study or edit these files to grasp how the Blackbox style mechanism
works.
You can use the
.BR [style] ", " [stylesdir] " and " [stylesmenu]
menu commands in your menu file to be able to select and change between styles
on the fly.
.PP
But you can also create a directory named
.I ~/.blackbox/Styles
in your homedirectory and put your own style files here.
Of course you may choose any name for this directory, but many downloadable
themes will rely on the name
.I Styles
(following the bb.themes.org naming scheme).
.PP
To understand how the style mechanism works, you should have a little knowledge
of how X resources work.
.PP
X resources consist of a key and a value.
The key is constructed of several smaller keys (sometimes referred to as
children), delimited by a period (`.').
Keys may also contain a star (`*') to serve as a wildcard, which means that one
line of typed text will match several keys.
This is useful for styles that are based on one or two colors.
.PP
Blackbox allows you to configure it's three main components: the toolbar, the
menus and the window decorations.
.PP
The little window that shows the x-y position while dragging windows, borrows
ite style from the window's titlebar.
.PP
Here are some quick examples:
.EX
toolbar.clock.color:	green
.EE
This sets the color resource of the toolbar clock to `green.' Another example:
.EX
menu*color:	rgb:3/4/5
.EE
This sets the color resource of the menu
.I and all of its `children'
to `rgb:3/4/5'.
(For a description of color names, see
.IR X (1).)
So this one also applies to
.IR menu.title.color " and " menu.frame.color .
And with
.EX
*font:	-b&h-lucida-medium-r-normal-*-*-140-*
.EE
you set the font resource for all keys to this font name all at once.
(For information about the fonts installed on your system, you can use a program like
.IR xfontsel "(1), " gtkfontsel ", or " xlsfonts "(1).)"
.PP
Now, what makes Blackbox just so spectacular, is its ability to render textures
on the fly.
Texture descriptions are specified directly to the key that they
should apply to, e.g.:
.ta \w'toolbar.clock.colorTo:\ 'u
.EX
toolbar.clock:	Raised Gradient Diagonal Bevel1
toolbar.clock.color:	rgb:8/6/4
toolbar.clock.colorTo:	rgb:4/3/2
.EE
Don't worry, we will explain right now!
A texture description consists of up to five fields, which are as follows:
.TP
.B Flat / Raised / Sunken
gives the component either a flat, raised or sunken appearance.
.TP
.B Gradient / Solid
tells Blackbox to draw either a solid color or a gradiented texture.
.TP
.B Horizontal / Vertical / Diagonal / Crossdiagonal / Pipecross / Elliptic / Rectangle / Pyramid
Select one of these texture types. They only work when also
.B Gradient
is specified!
.TP
.B Interlaced
tells Blackbox to interlace the texture (darken every other line).
This option is most commonly used with gradiented textures, but from Blackbox
version 0.60.3 on, it also works in solid textures.
.TP
.B Bevel1 / Bevel2
tells Blackbox which type of bevel to use.
Bevel1 is the default bevel.
The shading is placed on the edge of the image.
Bevel2 is an alternative.
The shading is placed one pixel in from the edge of the image.
.PP
Instead of a texture description, also the option
.B ParentRelative
is available, which makes the component appear as a part of its parent, e.g.
totally transparant.
.PP
All gradiented textures are composed of two color values: the
.IR color " and " colorTo " resources."
When
.B Interlaced 
is used in
.B Solid
mode, the
.I colorTo
resource is used to find the interlacing color.
.PP
Well, here is the complete component list, also all components together with
which kind of value they can contain.
Comments are preceded with an exclamation sign (!), which is also used for
comments in Blackbox style c.q. X resource files.
.PP

.PP
Now, this seems a long list, but remember, when you create your own style, you
can easily set lots of keys with a single command, e.g.
.EX
.ta \w'*unfocus.textColor:\ 'u
*color:	slategrey
*colorTo:	darkslategrey
*unfocus.color:	darkslategrey
*unfocus.colorTo:	black
*textColor:	white
*unfocus.textColor:	lightgrey
*font:	lucidasans-10
.EE
This sets already nice defaults for many components.
.SH THE SLIT
The slit is a special Blackbox window frame that can contain dockable
applications, e.g. the `bbtools.'
When applications are run in the slit they have no window borders of their own;
instead they are framed in the slit, and they are always visible in the current
workspace.
You can click button 3 on the edge of the slit window to get a menu to
determine its position and whether its contained applications should be grouped
horizontally or vertically.
.PP
Most dockable applications use the
.B -w
option to run in the slit.
For example, you could put in your
.IR ~/.xinitrc :
.EX
bbmail -w &
bbpager -w &
exec blackbox
.EE
Of course to use the slit you must have slit support compiled in.
.SH RESOURCE FILE
Usually the
.I ~/.blackboxrc
resource file is created and maintained bij Blackbox itself.
All options from the
.B [config]
menu (from 0.60.x on), the last selected style file, your workspace names and
so on are saved into this file.
However, there are some resources in it you might want to edit yourself:
.TP
.B session.menuFile:
This tells Blackbox where to look for its menu file.
.TP
.B session.screen0.toolbar.widthPercent:
This determines the amount (in %) of space the toolbar will take.
Default value is:
.IR 66 .
.TP
.B session.screen0.strftimeFormat:
This adjusts the way the current time is displayed in the toolbar.
The
.IR strftime (3)
format is used.
The default value is:
.IR "%I:%M %p" .
.TP
.B session.autoRaiseDelay:
Adjusts the delay (in ms) before focused windows will raise when using the
Autoraise option.
The default value is:
.IR 250 .
.TP
.B session.doubleClickInterval:
Adjust the delay (in ms) between mouse clicks for Blackbox to consider a double click.
Default value is:
.IR 250 .
.TP
.B session.cacheMax:
This tells Blackbox how much memory (in Kb) it may use to store cached pixmaps on
the X server.
If your machine runs short of memory, you may lower this value.
Default value is
.IR 200 .
.TP
.B session.cacheLife:
This tells Blackbox how long (in minutes) unused pixmaps may stay in the X
server's memory.
Default value is
.IR 5 .
.TP
.B session.colorsPerChannel:
.\" This can be some more worked out, e.g. why you should change it. (wbsoft)
Tells Blackbox how many colors to use per channel.
Value must be between 2 and 6.
When you run Blackbox on an 8-bit display, you must set this resource to 4.
Default value is
.IR 4.
.PP
When running Blackbox in a multiple desktop environment the
.B screen0
key can also be
.B screen1, 2
etc. for any appropriate desktop.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B HOME
Blackbox uses
.RB $ HOME
to find its
.I .blackboxrc
file, and to resolve stylefile and \-directory names.
.TP
.B DISPLAY
When no other display was given on the command line, Blackbox will start on the
display specified by this variable.

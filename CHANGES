At the request of some people, here is a Change log starting with 0.33.0.
Enjoy! :)


Changes from 0.31.0 to 0.33.0:
	- added #ifdef statements so the C preprocessor doesn't complain about
	  _GNU_SOURCE being redefined.
	- changed internal resource data structures
	- added Sticky windows functionality
	- remove old animation code bound with #ifdef ANIMATIONS
	- fixed a silly little bug that sometimes mapped a submenu when its
	  parent was unmapping itself
	- added ExecReconfigure option to execute a shell statement before
	  performing reconfiguration
	- rearranged window config code to reduce wait time while resizing
	- added internal macro BImageNoDitherSolid to make window frame
	  rendering faster (dithering a solid image is silly anyway)
	- added new menu file format
	- added Blackbox::validateWindow to provide a stabler environment for
	  Blackbox.  This gives blackbox more error checking and greater
	  stability.  For me, random crashes have (nearly) disappeared.
	- removed window name/class dependant frame texture/color
	- with 0.31.0, each entity read it's configuration from the rc database
	  loaded at start.  this has changed back to the old behaviour of
	  reading all configuration parameters at start, no database reads are
	  performed after the initial setup (save for reconfiguring).
	- configuration has changed to be a little cleaner, and a little more
          thorough.  See the Blackbox.ad and BlackboxMenu.ad for exmaples.
